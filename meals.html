                        Start with 1 cup of greens, such as spinach, kale, or romaine lettuce. Add in another cup of nonstarchy veggies, like carrots, tomatoes, or sweet peppers. “Anything crunchy and in season makes a good addition,” says New York City–based Sandra Arévalo, MPH, RDN, a spokesperson for the ADCES. Then add ⅔ cup of cooked quinoa,
                        which will provide a bit of protein — 5 g per the USDA. Finally, drizzle 1 tablespoon of your salad
                        dressing of choice (Arévalo suggests balsamic vinaigrette) over everything. However, be sure you steer clear of dressings high in sugar. Check the nutrition label and choose one with no more than 5 g of sugar per serving, Arévalo says.<br>

                    <p class="card-text">Sandwiches can be a quick, diabetes-friendly lunch option as long as you’re smart about your choice of bread.
                        Choose a bread that’s flat. “Bagels and rolls have too many calories and carbs,” Arévalo explains. Also, check that it’s 100 percent whole grain with roughly 30 g of carbs per serving, says Swift.
                        If you need condiments, avoid butter and mayo, which tend to add unnecessary calories and fat; opt for mustard instead, Arévalo says. Top your bread with two slices of lean meat like turkey or chicken breast and 1 ounce (oz) of low-fat mozzarella or Swiss cheese (these are naturally low in sodium, the Cleveland Clinic notes). Keep in mind that lunch meat can be high in sodium and fat, Swift warns. “Aim for lunch meats that have less than 250 milligrams [mg] of sodium and less than 3 g of fat per serving,” she says. Swift recommends Dietz & Watson No Salt Added Turkey Breast and Fred Meyer Simple Truth Organic Smoked Turkey Breast.
                        Don’t forget to add some crunch — not to mention vitamins, minerals, and fiber — with a few slices of romaine lettuce and tomato.<br>

                    <p class="card-text">If you’re a fan of soup, try a bean-based option.
                        Beans offer a wealth of heart-healthy, cholesterol-lowering fiber, says Swift. For people with diabetes, the ADA lists beans (kidney, pinto, navy, and black beans) as superfoods, a term applied to foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber and those that are beneficial for overall health and may help prevent disease.
                        Opt for bean soups that are low in fat and sodium — ideally no more than 3 g of fat and no more than 500 mg of sodium per serving, Swift says.
                        To make your meal heartier, Stefanski suggests pairing the soup with a low-fat cheese stick and a ¼ cup of hulled, unsalted sunflower seeds.<br>

                    <p class="card-text">Pasta can be tricky territory for people with type 2 diabetes. “[Pasta] usually gives you too many carbs and calories,” Arévalo explains. Then if you add a creamy sauce, you’ll also exceed your fat intake, she says.
                        The solution? Stick to whole-grain noodles topped with a ½ cup of tomato- or pesto-based sauce (opt for low-sodium versions whenever possible). Also, keep your pasta portions around a cup or less. “One cup of pasta has about 45 g of carbs, which is enough for a whole meal,” Swift says. Pair your cup of pasta with 3 to 5 oz of a lean protein like chicken, tofu, beans, or lentils.
                        Swift suggests adding nonstarchy veggies, wilted greens, onions, and tomatoes to fill you up without drastically increasing your carb count. As far as how many veggies: “The more, the better!” Swift says.<br>

                    <p class="card-text">When done right, pizza can fit into any healthy meal plan, including one for type 2 diabetes.
                        The key is to look for a pizza with a thin crust (ideally made with whole wheat) to reduce the carb count. Vegetarian options also tend to be best, though chicken is fine, Arévalo says. And when it comes to veggies (fresh or cooked), the more the better: “There are some pizzas that look like they have a salad on top — that’s the one you want,” Arévalo says.
                        Stick to one slice if you’re watching your weight, Arévalo says. If not, don’t exceed two. “Two slices of a 14-inch thin-crust pizza can fit into a quick lunch for anyone with diabetes,” Swift says.
                        Or make your own pizza at home so you can control the ingredients. This veggie pizza from Cookie and Kate features a variety of vegetables (cherry tomatoes, artichokes, bell peppers, olives, red onions, and baby spinach) and a whole-wheat crust. You’ll net six to eight servings — so one pizza could cover your lunch needs for an entire week!<br>

                        <p class="card-text">If you love tucking in to a warm bowl of stir-fry takeout, try whipping up your own version at home. “Homemade stir-fry will generally be much lower in carbohydrates than takeout,” Swift says. Hidden carbs can lurk in breaded and fried meats, as well as the cornstarch- or sugar-laden sauces that are commonly featured on takeout menus, she adds.
                            To do it, start with ⅔ cup of cooked brown rice. Top it with plenty of cooked vegetables like green peppers, onions, broccoli, bok choy, celery, and carrots (a variety is best!); then add 3 to 5 oz of a lean protein like chicken, tofu, or beans. Steer clear of breaded or fried meats, which pack hidden carbs, Swift says. Cover your creation with 1 tablespoon of low-sodium soy sauce.<br>

                        To make it, top ⅔ cup of cooked brown rice with 3 to 5 oz of roasted salmon or tuna. You can also use canned salmon or tuna if you prefer — just be sure to choose one that’s low in sodium and packed in water, Kimberlain says. From there, add one or two slices of avocado and as much sliced cucumber and roasted seaweed as you want (you can find prepackaged roasted seaweed at the grocery store). Add 1 tablespoon of low-sodium soy sauce and sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds, if you’d like.
                        Optional: Add a ¼ cup of homemade chipotle dressing. Kimberlain makes it by blending 1 cup of nonfat plain Greek yogurt, 1 chopped chipotle pepper, 2 teaspoons of chipotle sauce, ½ cup of chopped cilantro (optional), and juice from half a lime. A ¼ cup of the mixture adds about 31 calories and 2 g of carbs to the totals below.<br>

Spread it with 1 tablespoon of hummus or pesto, then add 3 oz of a lean protein of your choice. Feel free to go crazy with veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and shredded carrots. Top with a few slices of avocado.
                        Optional: Pair your wrap with a small piece of fruit. Aim for a tennis-ball-sized apple, 1 cup of chopped cantaloupe, or 1¼ cup of strawberries, Kimberlain says. This will add roughly 50 to 100 calories and 15 to 20 g of carbs to the totals below.<br>

Mix ½ cup of beans (black beans or kidney beans are always good choices) with ⅓ cup of brown rice. Add 3 to 5 oz of a lean protein like grilled chicken, tuna, lean ground turkey, or tofu. Throw in as many nonstarchy veggies (lettuce, spinach, and salsa are all great options) as you’d like. Top everything with a dollop (roughly 1 tablespoon) of plain nonfat Greek yogurt in place of sour cream, a squeeze of lime, and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.

Thinly spread a third of the mixture all over the wrap to make sure you taste it in every bite, she says. This will add roughly 105 calories and 7 g of carbs to the totals below.<br>
